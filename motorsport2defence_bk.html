<h3>The Motorsport to Defence Initiative</h3>
<p>The Motorsport Industry Association (MIA) established the Motorsport to Defence (M2D) initiative, which was launched in 2007. This initiative is aimed at helping motorsport companies to engage with the defence industry and maximise the business opportunities
    between the two sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its launch, both industries have benefited from the initiative but the defence sector in particular has been able to utilise motorsport’s unique skill set and expertise and find fast solutions to its engineering problems. In return, Motorsport Valley®
    has been granted seasonally-variable revenue streams.</p>
<p>We have supported members through working with leading defence primes and tier 1 suppliers, as well as at trade shows, such as DVD and DSEI. We strive to introduce our members and the motorsport industry to the defence sector.</p>
<p>The MIA is here to help our members navigate this industry, keep reading below to find out more about our programme and support services.<br /></p>

<h3>Motorsport to Defence Support&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Through MIA Membership, MIA members can engage with Nick Wills, Defence Development Director and Stu Olden, M2D Associate Advisor, who will provide initial meetings / calls to help businesses understand the opportunities within the defence sector. Between
    them they have a wealth of knowledge within this industry and have collectively supported businesses with unlocking new opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
